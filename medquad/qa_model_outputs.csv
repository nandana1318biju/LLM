GPT-2 (Foundation),"Q: What are the symptoms of Galactosialidosis ?
A:","What are the signs and symptoms of Galactosialidosis? The early infantile form of galactosialidosis is associated with hydrops fetalis, inguinal hernia, and hepatosplenomegaly. Additional features include abnormal bone development (dysostosis multiplex) and distinctive facial features that are often described as 'coarse.' Some infants have an enlarged heart; an eye abnormality called a cherry-red spot (identified through an eye examination); and kidney disease that can progress to kidney failure. Infants with this form are usually diagnosed between birth and 3 months of age. The late infantile form of galactosialidosis shares some features with the early infantile form, although the signs and symptoms are somewhat less severe and begin later in infancy. This form is characterized by short stature, dysostosis multiplex, heart valve problems, hepatosplenomegaly, and 'coarse' facial features. Other symptoms seen in some individuals with this type include intellectual disability, hearing loss, and a cherry-red spot. Children with this condition typically develop symptoms within the first year of life. The juvenile/adult form of galactosialidosis has signs and symptoms that are somewhat different than those of the other two types. This form is distinguished by difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), muscle twitches (myoclonus), seizures, and progressive intellectual disability. People with this form typically also have dark red spots on the skin (angiokeratomas), abnormalities in the bones of the spine, 'coarse' facial features, a cherry-red spot, vision loss, and hearing loss. The age at which symptoms begin to develop varies widely among affected individuals, but the average age is 16. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Galactosialidosis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the macula 90% Coarse facial features 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Hearing impairment 90% Opacification of the corneal stroma 90% Seizures 90% Short stature 90% Skeletal dysplasia 90% Hepatosplenomegaly 7.5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Cherry red spot of the macula - Conjunctival telangiectasia - Decreased beta-galactosidase activity - Dysostosis multiplex - Hemangioma - Intellectual disability - Severe short stature - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","Galactosialidosis is a condition in which the body's immune system is unable to fight off the infection. It is caused by a virus that causes a protein called Galactosialidosis.

GPT-2 (Foundation),"Q: Do you have information about Tubal Ligation
A:","Summary : Tubal ligation (getting your ""tubes tied"") is a type of surgery. It prevents a woman from getting pregnant. It is a permanent form of birth control.    The surgery closes the fallopian tubes, which connect the ovaries to the uterus. It usually takes about 30 minutes. Almost all women go home the same day. Women can return to most normal activities within a few days.    Tubal ligation can sometimes be reversed, but not always.","Yes, I do.

GPT-2 (Foundation),"Q: What is (are) Cancer in Children ?
A:","Cancer begins in the cells, which are the building blocks of your body. Normally, new cells form as you need them, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes, this process goes wrong. New cells form when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. The extra cells can form a tumor. Benign tumors aren't cancer while malignant ones are. Malignant tumor cells can invade nearby tissues or break away and spread to other parts of the body.     Children can get cancer in the same parts of the body as adults, but there are differences. Childhood cancers can occur suddenly, without early symptoms, and have a high rate of cure. The most common children's cancer is leukemia. Other cancers that affect children include brain tumors, lymphoma, and soft tissue sarcoma. Symptoms and treatment depend on the cancer type and how advanced it is. Treatment may include surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy.     NIH: National Cancer Institute",Cancer is a disease that is caused by a mutation in the DNA of the immune system.

GPT-2 (Foundation),"Q: Do you have information about Orthodontia
A:","Summary : Some people have naturally straight teeth that fit together. But if you have problems with your bite or the spacing of your teeth, you may need orthodontic care. Orthodontia is the branch of dentistry that deals with abnormalities of the teeth and jaw.    Orthodontic care involves the use of devices, such as braces, to       -  Straighten teeth    -  Correct problems with bite    -  Close gaps between teeth    -  Align lips and teeth properly        Most people who receive orthodontic care are kids, but adults get braces, too. In young children, orthodontic treatment may guide proper jaw growth. This can help permanent teeth to come in properly. Straight permanent teeth can help prevent tooth problems later on.","Yes, I do.

GPT-2 (Foundation),"Q: What causes Erythromelalgia ?
A:","What causes erythromelalgia? About 15% of cases of erythromelalgia are caused by mutations in the SCN9A gene. The SCN9A gene gives instructions for making part of a sodium channel which carries sodium into cells and helps them make and transmit electrical signals. These sodium channels are found in nerve cells that transmit pain signals to the spine and brain. Mutations that cause erythromelalgia cause increased transmission of pain signals, leading to the signs and symptoms of the condition. In some of these cases, an affected individual inherits the mutation from an affected parent. In other cases, a new mutation occurs for the first time in an individual with no history of the condition in the family. In the remainder of cases, the exact underlying cause is not currently known. Evidence suggests that it results from abnormalities in the normal narrowing and widening of certain blood vessels, leading to abnormalities in blood flow to the hands and feet. There may be a variety of non-genetic causes, or mutations in other genes that have not yet been identified.",It's a combination of the two. It's a combination of the two.
